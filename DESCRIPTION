Description: A versatile R visualization package that empowers 
    researchers with comprehensive visualization tools for seamlessly mapping peptides 
    to protein sequences, identifying distinct domains and regions of interest, 
    accentuating mutations, and highlighting post-translational modifications, 
    all while enabling comparisons across diverse experimental conditions. 
    Potential applications of 'PepMapViz' include the visualization of cross-software 
    mass spectrometry results at the peptide level for specific protein and domain 
    details in a linearized format and post-translational modification coverage 
    across different experimental conditions; unraveling insights into disease 
    mechanisms. It also enables visualization of major histocompatibility complex-presented peptides in 
    different antibody regions predicting immunogenicity in antibody drug development.

Note: The following words are correctly spelled domain-specific terms:
        MHC, 'PepMapViz', immunogenicity, linearized, spectrometry,
        translational. The package includes large datasets in the
        'extdata' directory, which are essential for demonstrating the
        functionality and performance of the tools provided. These
        datasets are necessary for reproducibility and comprehensive
        testing.
