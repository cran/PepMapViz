Description: A versatile R visualization package that empowers 
    researchers with comprehensive visualization tools for seamlessly mapping peptides 
    to protein sequences, identifying distinct domains and regions of interest, 
    accentuating mutations, and highlighting post-translational modifications, 
    all while enabling comparisons across diverse experimental conditions. 
    Potential applications of 'PepMapViz' include the visualization of cross-software 
    mass spectrometry results at the peptide level for specific protein and domain 
    details in a linearized format and post-translational modification coverage 
    across different experimental conditions; unraveling insights into disease 
    mechanisms. It also enables visualization of Major histocompatibility 
    complex-presented peptide clusters in different antibody regions predicting 
    immunogenicity in antibody drug development.

RoxygenNote: 7.3.2
Imports: shiny, ggplot2, stringr, ggforce, ggh4x, ggnewscale,
        data.table, rlang, DT
Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown, testthat (>= 3.0.0), mzID, MSnbase
Note: The package 'MSnbase' is used for parsing and processing mzTab
        files. While its non-portability limits usage on some
        platforms, it is essential for enabling analysis and
        integration of mzTab data in 'PepMapViz'. However, if the input
        file is not in mzTab format, 'MSnbase' is not required, and the
        package can function without it.
